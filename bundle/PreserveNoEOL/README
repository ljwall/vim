DESCRIPTION
This plugin causes Vim to omit the final newline (<EOL>) at the end of a
text file when you save it, if it was missing when the file was read. If the
file was read with <EOL> at the end, it will be saved with one. If it was read
without one, it will be saved without one.

Some (arguably broken) Windows applications (also several text editors) create
files without a final <EOL>, so if you have to interoperate with those, or
want to keep your commits to revision control clean of those changes, this
plugin is for you.

This works for all three line ending styles which Vim recognizes: DOS
(Windows), Unix, and traditional Mac. Multiple strategies are implemented to
handle these cases, so you can choose the one that fits you best.

HOW IT WORKS
Except for the internal Vimscript implementation, all other strategies first
let Vim save the file as usual (with a final <EOL>), and then post-process (on
BufWritePost) the file contents, using file-system API functions to truncate
the final <EOL>.

RELATED WORKS
The pure Vimscript implementation is based on the following VimTip:
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Preserve_missing_end-of-line_at_end_of_text_files

USAGE
If you always want to preserve a misssing <EOL> in text files, just put
    :let g:PreserveNoEOL = 1
into your vimrc and you're done. If you need more fine-grained control or
want to just turn this on in particular situations, you can use the following
commands or the buffer-local flag b:PreserveNoEOL.

:PreserveNoEOL          For the current buffer, the 'noeol' setting will be
                        preserved on writes. (Normally, Vim only does this for
                        'binary' files.) This has the same effect as setting
                        the marker buffer variable:
                            let b:PreserveNoEOL = 1

:SetNoEOL               When writing the current buffer, do not append an
                        <EOL> at the end of the last line, even when there
                        used to be one. Same as
                            setlocal noeol | let b:PreserveNoEOL = 1
